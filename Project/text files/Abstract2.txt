CONCLUSIONS : Families that provide evidence for segregation of an altered HPC1 gene are characterized by multiple cases of  prostate <DIS>cancer</DIS>  that , in most respects , are indistinguishable from nonhereditary cases .
Our study shows that a significant fraction of hereditary  prostate cancers  are diagnosed in advanced stages , emphasizing the clinical importance of early detection in men potentially carrying prostate <DIS>cancer</DIS> susceptibility genes .
These findings support the current recommendations to screen men with a positive family history of  prostate <DIS>cancer</DIS>  beginning at age 40 years .
 <TO_SEE> CONTEXT : There is a substantial risk of a second <DIS>cancer</DIS> for persons with hereditary retinoblastoma , which is enhanced by radiotherapy .
Cumulative incidence ( +/-SE ) of a second  <DIS>cancer</DIS>  at 50 years after diagnosis was 51.0 % ( +/-6.2 % ) for hereditary  retinoblastoma  , and 5.0 % ( +/-3.0 % ) for nonhereditary  retinoblastoma  .

 <TO_SEE> BACKGROUND : The cause of severe acquired hyperammonemia , an uncommon but often fatal complication of organ transplantation and chemotherapy for <DIS>cancer</DIS> , is obscure .
 Cytochrome P450 1A1 ( CYP1A1 ) and glutathione S-transferase M1 ( GSTM1 ) genetic polymorphisms are involved in the activation and detoxification of chemical carcinogens found in tobacco smoke ; thus they may influence host susceptibility to  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
In this study at Massachusetts General Hospital ( Boston , MA , USA ) of 416 cases and 446 controls ( mostly White ) we evaluated the association between the CYP1A1 MspI and GSTM1 polymorphisms and  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  risk , and their interaction with cigarette smoke .
After adjusting for age , gender , pack-years of smoking , and years since quitting smoking , while neither the CYP1A1 MspI heterozygous genotype alone nor the GSTM1 null genotype alone were associated with a significant increase in  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  risk , having both genetic traits was associated with a twofold increase in risk ( 95 percent confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.0-3.4 ) .
Our data did not provide enough evidence for a substantial modification of the effect of pack-years on  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  risk by the CYP1A1 MspI and GSTM1 genotypes .

the patient was a 62-year-old man with  squamous cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  , which was first successfully treated by a  combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy  , but showed local recurrence after 8 months .
these results suggested that the  sp1 decoy strategy  would be effective for regulating  tumor growth  by simultaneously reducing <DIS>cancer</DIS> cell ( a ) angiogenic growth factor expression , ( b ) proliferation , and ( c ) invasiveness .
 we have documented previously that  adenovirus-mediated interleukin 12 ( il-12 ) gene therapy  is effective for  orthotopic tumor  control and suppression of  pre-established metastases in a preclinical prostate <DIS>cancer</DIS> model  ( y. nasu et al. , gene ther .
clinically ,  oral administration of uft  has proved to be effective as an  adjuvant therapy  after surgery for some  malignant tumors such as non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
moreover ,  uft  has proved to be effective for  inoperable advanced malignancies such as colorectal <DIS>cancer</DIS>  , especially in combination with  leucovorin or cisplatin  .
 a phase ii study of fractionated administration of  irinotecan ( cpt-11 ) and cisplatin ( cddp )  in patients with  non-small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  was conducted .
 a 68-year-old man underwent  curative pancreaticoduodenectomy  for  bile duct <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
 stages of  non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  that are potential candidates for  surgical resection  have been treated in several ways :  surgery  alone is curative in only two-thirds of cases and  post-operative radiotherapy ( rt )  provides only weak control of advanced-stage disease .
 several studies have suggested that  non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  patients whose tumors have neuroendocrine ( ne ) features may be more responsive to  chemotherapy  in addition , increased expression of p53 and her2 may confer relative chemotherapy resistance and shortened survival .
the <DIS>cancer</DIS> and leukemia group b performed a series of studies involving  sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation  for patients with  unresectable stage iii nsclc  .

  gemcitabine and carboplatin  for patients with  advanced non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  
methods and materials : eleven patients with  small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  , who had presented complete response of disease after  chemotherapy  and  radical radiotherapy in the lung  , were prescribed to receive a prophylacting cranial irradiation ( pci ) with a 6 mev linear accelerator .
 <TO_SEE> the standard care for patients with  non-small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  is  chemotherapy of supportive care  , with  surgery  being reserved for palliation of symptoms ; however , there is a small group of patients with a finite number of  extrathoracic metastases ( oligometastases )  who may experience improved survival by  resection of their metastases and the primary site  , with or without systemic treatment .
 purpose : many patients with  locally advanced non-small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( la-nsclc )  are eligible for  combined-modality therapy ( cmt ; chemotherapy and radiotherapy )  .
 expandable metal stents  were inserted in two patients with  severe dyspnea due to tracheal stenosis caused by lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> and esophageal cancer  .
 expandable metal stents  were inserted in two patients with  severe dyspnea due to tracheal stenosis caused by lung cancer and esophageal <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
 background : at present the  addition of thoracic irradiation to combination chemotherapy  is a standard treatment for  limited staged small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
we conducted a phase ii study of  etoposide ( vp-16 ) -ifosfamide-cisplatin ( vip ) combination chemotherapy plus early concurrent thoracic irradiation  for the patients with previously  untreated limited small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  in order to assess if the treatment modality could improve the response rate and the toxicity .
methods : forty-four patients with  limited small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  were treated with  etoposide-ifosfamide-cisplatin and concurrent thoracic irradiation  .
conclusion :  vip combination chemotherapy and early concurrent thoracic irradiation  for patients with  limited stage small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  revealed excellent antitumor response with tolerable toxicity .
 background : the role of  surgical staging  of patients with  non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  continues to evolve .
 purpose : given the cisplatin-related myelotoxicity and nonhematologic toxicities , we were prompted to undertake a study of the  noncisplatin combination of paclitaxel plus gemcitabine  to evaluate the efficacy , tolerance , and survival of this combination in patients with  locally advanced and metastatic non-small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  .
in contrast , the introduction and improvement of  chemotherapy  since the 1970s gave rise to an improvement in - only short-term ( < 2 years ) - survival for patients with  small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
between july 1992 and december 1997 , 1799 patients were diagnosed as having  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  in our hospital and 926 patients received  chemotherapy and/or thoracic radiotherapy  .
the administration of  mitomycin c  in addition to  cisplatin-based regimens  for patients with  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  should be carefully considered .
 the degree of healing and damage of the bronchial wall after  photodynamic therapy , nd-yag laser and electrocautery  for  intraluminal early-stage <DIS>cancer</DIS>  have been analysed .
 to examine whether efficacy of postoperative oral administration of  uft , a 5-fluorouracil derivative chemotherapeutic agent  , may be influenced by incidence of apoptosis ( apoptosis index ) or apoptosis-related gene status ( p53 and bcl-2 ) of the tumour , a total of 162 patients with  pathologic stage i non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  were retrospectively reviewed .
 urpose : to assess results with twice-daily high-dose  radiotherapy ( rt )  for  non-small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  .
 we aimed to investigate whether biological factors related to radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity have prognostic significance in  non-small-cell-lung-<DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  patients treated with daily low doses of  cisplatin and radiotherapy  .
methods : we placed  stents  for both  esophageal and tracheobronchial stenoses  in 8 patients ( 7 with esophageal <DIS>cancer</DIS> and 1 with lung cancer ) .
methods : we placed  stents  for both  esophageal and tracheobronchial stenoses  in 8 patients ( 7 with esophageal cancer and 1 with lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ) .
because placement of stents in both the esophagus and tracheobronchus has a high risk of enlargement of the fistula , a  covered metallic stent  is preferable for  esophageal <DIS>cancer</DIS> involving the tracheobronchus  .
conclusions :  gamma knife radiosurgery  without prophylactic wbrt could be a primary choice of treatment for patients with as many as 10  cerebral metastases from nonsmall cell <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
 objectives : to review the spectrum of presentation and the  surgical management  of  non small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  and the role of various diagnostic modalities in predicting the post-operative stage and the correlation of the post-operative stage with the chances of recurrence .
 to explore the induction of  chemotherapy ( ct )  dna damage and its correlation with tumor response and patient survival , we undertook the present study in 20  small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  patients .
in patients with  metastatic colorectal <DIS>cancer</DIS>  ,  intravenous oxaliplatin  has been trialled as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents .
in patients with  advanced ovarian <DIS>cancer</DIS>  , first-line therapy with  oxaliplatin/cyclophosphamide  achieved an objective response rate which did not differ significantly from that of  cisplatin/cyclophosphamide  ( 33 vs 42 % ) .
in addition ,  oxaliplatin  has shown efficacy in patients with  platinum-pretreated ovarian <DIS>cancer</DIS>  and achieved objective response rates similar to paclitaxel in this setting ( 16 vs 17 % ) .
promising results have also been found with  oxaliplatin  in patients with  non-hodgkin 's lymphoma , breast <DIS>cancer</DIS> , mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer  .
promising results have also been found with  oxaliplatin  in patients with  non-hodgkin 's lymphoma , breast cancer , mesothelioma and non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
conclusion :  oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil/folinic acid  is an effective treatment option for patients with  metastatic colorectal <DIS>cancer</DIS>  , both as a first-line therapy and in patients refractory to previous chemotherapy .
additional clinical investigation of  oxaliplatin  in patients with other  cancers  is warranted given the promising results achieved in early trials , most notably in patients with platinum-pretreated ovarian <DIS>cancer</DIS> .

 objective : several reports emphasize the importance of  en-bloc resection  as the optimal surgical treatment of  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  with chest wall invasion .
methods : between 1981 and 1998 , 100 patients ( 90 male ; ten female ) , with a median age of 60 years ( 36-84 ) , underwent  radical en-bloc resection  of  non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  with chest wall involvement .
over the past 17 years ( 1981 to 1997 ) , 29 patients underwent  complete pulmonary resection  for  primary lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  accompanied by satellite nodules in the same lobe as the primary .
of 1 , 042 patients with  primary lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  who underwent  resection  from 1982 to 1995 , 549 patients with adenocarcinoma ( ad ) and 363 with squamous cell carcinoma ( sq ) were included in this study .
for  small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  , which accounts for approximately 20 % of cases of lung cancer , the primary treatment is  chemotherapy  and in the majority of cases the primary aim is to control the disease which generally would have spread beyond the lungs at the time of presentation .

 a growing body of evidence suggests that  postoperative irradiation  for  non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  may cause life-threatening toxicity and , when the risk of local-regional recurrence is low , the toxicity of irradiation may outweight the benefit .
 for patients with  stage i or ii non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  ,  surgical resection  is considered the standard of care .
 background :  prophylactic cranial irradiation  halves the rate of brain metastases in patients with  small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
objectives : this study aims to test whether  prophylactic cranial irradiation  prolongs survival of patients with  small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  in complete remission .
reviewer 's conclusions :  prophylactic cranial irradiation  significantly improves survival and disease-free survival for patients with  small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  in complete remission .
methods :  non-small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  cells were treated with  gemcitabine  , harvested , and nuclear extracts analyzed for nf-kappab dna binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
  combination chemotherapy  is the cornerstone of treatment that confers a meaningful survival benefit for patients with  small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
in single-agent phase ii studies ,  irinotecan  yielded response rates between 16 % and 47 % in patients with previously treated  small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
a phase ii study of  irinotecan in combination with cisplatin ( platinol )  resulted in a response rate of 86 % and a median survival of 13.0 months in patients with  extensive-disease small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
based on these results , the  irinotecan and cisplatin combination  is a new standard regimen in the treatment of  extensive-disease small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
 background : both  gemcitabine and etoposide  are active in the treatment of  small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  , and are characterised by mild toxicity profiles .
 background : to find the maximum tolerated dose for  ifosfamide in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin  in  small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  patients ( sclc ) , who are resistant to cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin and etoposide ( cde ) .
many  endobronchial treatment modalities  are available to supplement traditional therapies for  advanced lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
methods : the author reviews the use of several  endobronchial treatment modalities that can augment standard antitumor therapies  for advanced  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  , including rigid and flexible bronchoscopy , laser therapy , endobronchial prosthesis , and photodynamic therapy .
conclusions :  endobronchial interventions  are important adjuncts in the multimodality management of  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  and should become standard considerations in the management of patients with advanced lung cancer .

 purpose : this randomized trial was designed to determine whether  paclitaxel plus carboplatin ( pc )  offered a survival advantage over  vinorelbine plus cisplatin ( vc )  for patients with  advanced non -- small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
conclusion :  pc  is equally efficacious as  vc  for the treatment of  advanced non -- small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  .
 purpose : a prospective randomized trial in small-cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( sclc ) was performed to determine if intensification of the platinum dose by giving  cisplatin and carboplatin  in combination to patients with  sclc  yields higher response rates and survival , than  carboplatin alone in a combination chemotherapy regimen  .
 the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among technetium-99m tetrofosmin ( tc-tf ) accumulation in untreated small cell lung <DIS>cancer</DIS> ( sclc ) , the expression of p-glycoprotein ( pgp ) and multidrug resistance related protein-1 ( mrp1 ) , and the response to  chemotherapy  in patients with  untreated sclc  .

 animal studies suggest that the kidney is involved in the elimination of  recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( rhg-csf )  , which is used for patients with  neutropenia  during  <DIS>cancer</DIS>   chemotherapy  .
in a pivotal phase iii trial , 242 patients with  advanced ovarian <DIS>cancer</DIS>  were randomised to receive treatment with  cisplatin  100 mg/m2 and  cyclophosphamide  1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with or without pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 910 mg/m2 .
<TO_SEE> in another randomised phase iii trial in 303 patients with  head and neck <DIS>cancer</DIS>  undergoing  irradiation therapy  ( total dose 50 to 70gy ) , pretreatment with intravenous  amifostine  200 mg/m2 significantly reduced the incidence of acute and late grade > or =2  xerostomia  .
 amifostine  ( 340 mg/m2 ) also provided significant protection against  pneumonitis and oesophagitis  in patients with  lung <DIS>cancer</DIS>  receiving  thoracic irradiation  in a preliminary report from a phase iii trial ( n = 144 ) .
<TO_SEE> conclusion : the results of phase iii trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of  amifostine  as a cytoprotectant to ameliorate  cisplatin-induced cumulative renal toxicity  , for which it is the only agent proven to be effective , and  neutropenia  in patients with advanced ovarian <DIS>cancer</DIS> , and to reduce  xerostomia  in patients with  head and neck cancer  receiving  irradiation therapy  .

  induction <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> ( cisplatin + vinorelbine )  is found to be markedly effective for  squamous cell lung carcinoma with sarcoidosis  -- a case report 
the patient was a 62-year-old man with  squamous cell lung cancer  , which was first successfully treated by a  combination of radiation therapy and <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  , but showed local recurrence after 8 months .
the  combination of txt , gem and cddp  may be effective for  recurrent non-small-cell lung carcinoma  , even in patients that have failed to respond to more than one <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> regimen .
conclusion : as expected , the type of  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  we used , to treat  non-seminomatous germ-cell tumors  proved to be highly effective for  seminomatous types  , as well .
despite the marked toxicity of the initial  intensive <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  , the treatments are tolerable and effective in the control of  extra-thoracic micrometastases  , whereas they are less effective for thoracic primary tumor .
 several studies have suggested that  non-small cell lung cancer ( nsclc )  patients whose tumors have neuroendocrine ( ne ) features may be more responsive to  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in addition , increased expression of p53 and her2 may confer relative chemotherapy resistance and shortened survival .
 several studies have suggested that  non-small cell lung cancer ( nsclc )  patients whose tumors have neuroendocrine ( ne ) features may be more responsive to  chemotherapy  in addition , increased expression of p53 and her2 may confer relative <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> resistance and shortened survival .
the cancer and leukemia group b performed a series of studies involving  sequential <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> followed by radiation  for patients with  unresectable stage iii nsclc  .
methods and materials : eleven patients with  small cell lung cancer ( sclc )  , who had presented complete response of disease after  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  and  radical radiotherapy in the lung  , were prescribed to receive a prophylacting cranial irradiation ( pci ) with a 6 mev linear accelerator .
 <TO_SEE> the standard care for patients with  non-small-cell lung cancer  is  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> of supportive care  , with  surgery  being reserved for palliation of symptoms ; however , there is a small group of patients with a finite number of  extrathoracic metastases ( oligometastases )  who may experience improved survival by  resection of their metastases and the primary site  , with or without systemic treatment .
whether the era of  platinum-based <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in the treatment of  nsclc  should continue or not must be determined by phase iii trials , evaluating the use of a platinum agent with one of the new agent combinations .
 purpose : many patients with  locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( la-nsclc )  are eligible for  combined-modality therapy ( cmt ; <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> and radiotherapy )  .
 over the past twenty years  combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  has continued to produce small survival gains for patients with  sclc  .
extent of pulmonary involvement at diagnosis , response of  pm  after  induction <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  , local treatment of pm thereafter , and clinical outcome were recorded .
conclusions : the comparable survival of patients with poor and good response of  pm  to  induction <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  suggests that  wli  may benefit poor responders .
 background : at present the  addition of thoracic irradiation to combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  is a standard treatment for  limited staged small cell lung cancer  .
we conducted a phase ii study of  etoposide ( vp-16 ) -ifosfamide-cisplatin ( vip ) combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> plus early concurrent thoracic irradiation  for the patients with previously  untreated limited small cell lung cancer  in order to assess if the treatment modality could improve the response rate and the toxicity .
conclusion :  vip combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> and early concurrent thoracic irradiation  for patients with  limited stage small cell lung cancer  revealed excellent antitumor response with tolerable toxicity .
we evaluated the role of  systemic <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  for patients with  malignant pleural effusions from nsclc  .
methods : we analyzed 34 patients who were found to have  malignant pleural effusions  in the course of diagnosis of 118 patients enrolled in three consecutive clinical trials on advanced  nsclc  assessing  combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> of cisplatin , ifosfamide , and irinotecan with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support  .
conclusions : both the response rate and survival data in this retrospective study suggest a high degree of activity of this  combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in patients with  malignant pleural effusions from nsclc  .
in contrast , the introduction and improvement of  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  since the 1970s gave rise to an improvement in - only short-term ( < 2 years ) - survival for patients with  small-cell lung cancer  .
between july 1992 and december 1997 , 1799 patients were diagnosed as having  lung cancer  in our hospital and 926 patients received  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> and/or thoracic radiotherapy  .

we conclude that for patients with  osteosarcoma of the extremities  treated with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  : ( a ) the pattern of systemic relapse changes according to the efficacy of the protocol of <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> used .
we evaluated the role of  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  for patients with  brain metastases from nsclc  .
methods : we analyzed 30 patients who were discovered to have brain metastases during the diagnosis of 121 patients enrolled in three consecutive clinical trials on  advanced nsclc  assessing  combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> of cisplatin , ifosfamide and irinotecan with rhg-csf support  .
conclusions : both the response rate and survival data in this retrospective study suggest a high degree of activity of this  combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in patients with  brain metastases from nsclc  .
 to explore the induction of  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> ( ct )  dna damage and its correlation with tumor response and patient survival , we undertook the present study in 20  small cell lung cancer ( sclc )  patients .
conclusion :  oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil/folinic acid  is an effective treatment option for patients with  metastatic colorectal cancer  , both as a first-line therapy and in patients refractory to previous <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> .
standard treatment of  sclc  consists of  platinum-based combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  , with thoracic irradiation added for patients with limited-stage disease .
for  small cell lung cancer ( sclc )  , which accounts for approximately 20 % of cases of lung cancer , the primary treatment is  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  and in the majority of cases the primary aim is to control the disease which generally would have spread beyond the lungs at the time of presentation .
efforts at improving survival for  early-stage nsclc  patients have focused on the use of  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  administered postoperatively ( adjuvant ) or preoperatively ( neoadjuvant or induction ) to eradicate  micrometastatic disease  .
 <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  administered before surgery or definitive irradiation has improved survival rates in patients with  stage iii nsclc  .

we present the case of a patient with  metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and renal failure  who underwent successful  systemic <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> with paclitaxel and carboplatin  .
 background : the objective of this phase ii study was to evaluate the concept of  sequential <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in the treatment of patients with  advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc )  by the administration of  carboplatin plus gemcitabine followed by of paclitaxel  .
conclusions : this study is the first to evaluate  planned sequential <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in patients with  nsclc  .
 purpose : a prospective randomized trial in small-cell lung cancer ( sclc ) was performed to determine if intensification of the platinum dose by giving  cisplatin and carboplatin  in combination to patients with  sclc  yields higher response rates and survival , than  carboplatin alone in a combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> regimen  .
conclusions : the  intensification of platinum dose ( cisplatin plus carboplatin ) in combination <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  significantly increased the complete response rate , overall survival and number of two-year survivors among  sclc  patients with limited disease compared to  combination therapy with carboplatin alone  , suggesting that a more aggressive treatment to this category of patients is worthwhile , while no difference in treatment outcome was observed for patients with extensive disease .
 the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among technetium-99m tetrofosmin ( tc-tf ) accumulation in untreated small cell lung cancer ( sclc ) , the expression of p-glycoprotein ( pgp ) and multidrug resistance related protein-1 ( mrp1 ) , and the response to  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in patients with  untreated sclc  .
tc-tf chest scintigraphy correlated well with pgp or mrp1 expression and accurately predicted the response to  <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  in patients with  sclc  .
 animal studies suggest that the kidney is involved in the elimination of  recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( rhg-csf )  , which is used for patients with  neutropenia  during  cancer   <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS>  .
  amifostine ( wr-2721 )  is a cytoprotective agent that protects a broad range of normal tissues from the  toxic effects of <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> and radiotherapy  without attenuating tumour response .
over 6 cycles of therapy ,  amifostine  significantly reduced  haematological , renal and neurological toxicities  : treatment delays , treatment discontinuation and days in hospital related to these adverse events were also significantly reduced in patients receiving amifostine versus patients receiving <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> alone .
 As noted previously , using <DIS>chemotherapy</DIS> , a small proportion of patients with  advanced malignant melanoma  , despite prior therapy , may achieve prolonged objective regression with  rIFN-alpha A  .

 BACKGROUND : An increasing number of reports indicate symptomatic relief of biliary colic symptoms after  <DIS>cholecystectomy</DIS>  for  biliary dyskinesia  .
Despite this ,  <DIS>cholecystectomy</DIS>  as a treatment for  biliary dyskinesia  remains controversial .
Our aim was to determine efficacy of  <DIS>cholecystectomy</DIS>  in alleviating  biliary dyskinesia symptoms  and the correlation with histologic findings .
CONCLUSIONS :  Biliary dyskinesia  patients who underwent  <DIS>cholecystectomy</DIS>  had significantly greater symptom improvement compared with nonsurgical patients .
 <DIS>Cholecystectomy</DIS>  should be a first-line therapy for  biliary dyskinesia  patients .

 Chronic  telogen effluvium  : potential complication for <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> in female  androgenetic alopecia  ? 
 Placebo in drug <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> 
methods : we analyzed 34 patients who were found to have  malignant pleural effusions  in the course of diagnosis of 118 patients enrolled in three consecutive <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> on advanced  nsclc  assessing  combination chemotherapy of cisplatin , ifosfamide , and irinotecan with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support  .
these data suggest that her2/erbb-2 should be evaluated prospectively as a prognostic indicator and <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> using  antibodies  that target this receptor should be considered for the treatment of patients with  osteogenic sarcoma  .
methods : we analyzed 30 patients who were discovered to have brain metastases during the diagnosis of 121 patients enrolled in three consecutive <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> on  advanced nsclc  assessing  combination chemotherapy of cisplatin , ifosfamide and irinotecan with rhg-csf support  .
the drug is currently in phase iii <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> for patients with  non-small cell lung cancer  in combination with  paclitaxel and carboplatin  , as well as in  advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer  in combination with  mitoxantrone  .

The data resulting from these <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> indicate that  interferon alfa-2a  is effective in inducing hematologic remissions in the majority of minimally treated ,  benign-phase CML  , Ph1-positive patients .
 More than 1600 patients with  neoplastic disorders  have received  recombinant human interferon alfa-2a ( Roferon-A , Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley , NJ )  as part of ongoing or completed <DIS>clinical trials</DIS> .
We now show that highly purified populations of very primitive neoplastic progenitor cells obtained directly from <DIS>CML </DIS>patients survive and proliferate in vitro for several weeks in the absence of any added growth factors ( except insulin ) .
Nevertheless , both primary <DIS>CML </DIS>cells and BCR-ABL+ BAF3 cells show the same dose-dependent sensitivity to TNF-alpha or ceramide-induced apoptosis as their respective normal counterparts .
Switch substrate retrovectors ( SSR ) contain a long-terminal repeat-driven neomycin ( Neo ) gene for proviral chromosomal maintenance ( pre- and post-S recombination ) and a <DIS>CMV </DIS>promoter-driven , chimeric hygromycin-thymidine kinase ( Hytk ) gene ( flanked by S mu and S gamma 2b recombination targets ) to select for ( ganciclovir ) and against ( hygromycin B ) S region recombination .
Patient 1 demonstrated dramatic clearing of his  MCV lesions  when  intravenous cidofovir therapy  was started for his  treatment-resistant bilateral <DIS>CMV </DIS>retinitis  and because of  cidofovir 's  possible activity against  MCV  .

Results of early rehabilitation seem to be influenced by duration and etiology of  deafness  , experience with <DIS>hearing </DIS>aids , and other factors .
In order to understand and model cochlear processes involved in TEOAE generation , it needs to be known whether the presence of normal <DIS>hearing </DIS>leads automatically to generation of TEOAEs .
The present study set out to establish in a large sample if any ears could be found that lacked TEOAEs despite normal <DIS>hearing </DIS>threshold levels ( HTL ) .
 OBJECTIVE : We determined the sensitivity and specificity of neonatal brain-stem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEP ) as markers for subsequent  <DIS>hearing </DIS>impairment  and for  developmental problems  found later in infancy and childhood .
The sensitivity and specificity of an elevated threshold on the neonatal BAEP for detecting subsequent <DIS>hearing </DIS>loss , and the relationship of any neonatal BAEP abnormality to language or developmental disorders in infancy , were calculated .
Most significantly , 7 ( 58 % ) of the 12 children with subsequent  sensorineural <DIS>hearing </DIS>loss  had left the hospital after showing normal results on threshold tests .
There was no significant difference in the frequency of  <DIS>hearing </DIS>loss  between subjects with abnormal ( 5/21 , or 24 % ) and those with normal BAEP thresholds ( 7/59 , or 12 % ; Fisher Exact Test , p = 0.28 ) .
Therefore the sensitivity of neonatal BAEP testing for predicting subsequent  <DIS>hearing </DIS>loss  was only 42 % .
Neonatal BAEP specificity for excluding subsequent  <DIS>hearing </DIS>loss  was 76 % .
CONCLUSIONS : Neonatal BAEP threshold recordings were of limited value for predicting subsequent  <DIS>hearing </DIS>loss  common in  ECMO  -treated survivors .
Because neonatal  ECMO  is associated with a high risk of  <DIS>hearing </DIS>and receptive language disorders  , parents should be counseled that audiologic and developmental follow-up evaluations in surviving children are essential regardless of the results of neonatal BAEP testing .

 OBJECTIVE : To determine whether patients with  myocardial amyloidosis  due either to AL ( primary ) amyloid or familial amyloid have distinguishing echocardiographic or electrocardiographic features ; and to compare the prevalence of  <DIS>heart failure</DIS>  and survival in the two types of  amyloidosis  in relation to echocardiographic findings .
Clinical factors associated with a higher death rate were  syncope  ( P=.012 ) ,  arterial hypotension  ( P=.021 ) , history of  congestive <DIS>heart failure</DIS>  ( P=.013 ) , and  chronic pulmonary disease  ( P=.032 ) .
 <TO_SEE> Despite  Beta-blockade therapy  has been considered as an absolute contraindication in the treatment of  <DIS>heart failure</DIS>  , it has been shown that they could have a beneficial effect , provided that they were introduced at very low dose , and very progressively in addition of the traditional treatment .
The advances in the understanding of the neuro-hormonal mechanisms of <DIS>heart failure</DIS> have modified the therapeutic strategy : the deleterious effect of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system on the myocardium has served as the rationale for randomized clinical trials comparing beta-blockade to placebo : the current data are promising , suggesting a beneficial effect on survival as well as on quality of life .
However , these results have to be confirmed by larger trials , currently underway , before to consider that beta-blockade should definitely be incorporated in the treatment of <DIS>heart failure</DIS> .

 BACKGROUND :  Accelerated <DIS>infusion </DIS>of alteplase ( tissue plasminogen activator )  over a period of 90 minutes induces more rapid lysis of  coronary-artery thrombi  than a 3-hour infusion .
METHODS : In 398 hospitals , 7169 patients with  acute myocardial infarction  were randomly assigned to weight-adjusted , accelerated <DIS>infusion </DIS>of 100 mg of  alteplase  or to a bolus of 50 mg of  alteplase  over a period of 1 to 3 minutes followed 30 minutes later by a second bolus of 50 mg ( or 40 mg for patients who weighed less than 60 kg ) .
RESULTS : Thirty-day mortality was higher in the double-bolus group than in the accelerated-<DIS>infusion </DIS>group : 7.98 percent as compared with 7.53 percent .
The respective rates of any  stroke  and of  hemorrhagic stroke  were 1.92 and 1.12 percent after double-bolus  alteplase  , as compared with 1.53 and 0.81 percent after an accelerated <DIS>infusion </DIS>of  alteplase  ( P=0.24 and P=0.23 , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Double-bolus  alteplase  was not shown to be equivalent , according to the prespecified criteria , to accelerated <DIS>infusion </DIS>with regard to 30-day mortality .
Therefore ,  accelerated <DIS>infusion </DIS>of alteplase  over a period of 90 minutes remains the preferred regimen .

 Cytochrome P450 1A1 ( CYP1A1 ) and glutathione S-transferase M1 ( GSTM1 ) genetic polymorphisms are involved in the activation and detoxification of chemical carcinogens found in tobacco smoke ; thus they may influence host susceptibility to  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
In this study at Massachusetts General Hospital ( Boston , MA , USA ) of 416 cases and 446 controls ( mostly White ) we evaluated the association between the CYP1A1 MspI and GSTM1 polymorphisms and  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  risk , and their interaction with cigarette smoke .
After adjusting for age , gender , pack-years of smoking , and years since quitting smoking , while neither the CYP1A1 MspI heterozygous genotype alone nor the GSTM1 null genotype alone were associated with a significant increase in  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  risk , having both genetic traits was associated with a twofold increase in risk ( 95 percent confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.0-3.4 ) .
Our data did not provide enough evidence for a substantial modification of the effect of pack-years on  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  risk by the CYP1A1 MspI and GSTM1 genotypes .

  Small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  can express CD34 antigen .
the patient was a 62-year-old man with  squamous cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  , which was first successfully treated by a  combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy  , but showed local recurrence after 8 months .
clinically ,  oral administration of uft  has proved to be effective as an  adjuvant therapy  after surgery for some  malignant tumors such as non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
 a phase ii study of fractionated administration of  irinotecan ( cpt-11 ) and cisplatin ( cddp )  in patients with  non-small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  was conducted .
 stages of  non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  that are potential candidates for  surgical resection  have been treated in several ways :  surgery  alone is curative in only two-thirds of cases and  post-operative radiotherapy ( rt )  provides only weak control of advanced-stage disease .
 several studies have suggested that  non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  patients whose tumors have neuroendocrine ( ne ) features may be more responsive to  chemotherapy  in addition , increased expression of p53 and her2 may confer relative chemotherapy resistance and shortened survival .

  gemcitabine and carboplatin  for patients with  advanced non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  
methods and materials : eleven patients with  small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  , who had presented complete response of disease after  chemotherapy  and  radical radiotherapy in the lung  , were prescribed to receive a prophylacting cranial irradiation ( pci ) with a 6 mev linear accelerator .
 <TO_SEE> the standard care for patients with  non-small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  is  chemotherapy of supportive care  , with  surgery  being reserved for palliation of symptoms ; however , there is a small group of patients with a finite number of  extrathoracic metastases ( oligometastases )  who may experience improved survival by  resection of their metastases and the primary site  , with or without systemic treatment .
 purpose : many patients with  locally advanced non-small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( la-nsclc )  are eligible for  combined-modality therapy ( cmt ; chemotherapy and radiotherapy )  .
 expandable metal stents  were inserted in two patients with  severe dyspnea due to tracheal stenosis caused by <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> and esophageal cancer  .
 background : at present the  addition of thoracic irradiation to combination chemotherapy  is a standard treatment for  limited staged small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
we conducted a phase ii study of  etoposide ( vp-16 ) -ifosfamide-cisplatin ( vip ) combination chemotherapy plus early concurrent thoracic irradiation  for the patients with previously  untreated limited small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  in order to assess if the treatment modality could improve the response rate and the toxicity .
methods : forty-four patients with  limited small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  were treated with  etoposide-ifosfamide-cisplatin and concurrent thoracic irradiation  .
conclusion :  vip combination chemotherapy and early concurrent thoracic irradiation  for patients with  limited stage small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  revealed excellent antitumor response with tolerable toxicity .
 background : the role of  surgical staging  of patients with  non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  continues to evolve .
 purpose : given the cisplatin-related myelotoxicity and nonhematologic toxicities , we were prompted to undertake a study of the  noncisplatin combination of paclitaxel plus gemcitabine  to evaluate the efficacy , tolerance , and survival of this combination in patients with  locally advanced and metastatic non-small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  .
in contrast , the introduction and improvement of  chemotherapy  since the 1970s gave rise to an improvement in - only short-term ( < 2 years ) - survival for patients with  small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
between july 1992 and december 1997 , 1799 patients were diagnosed as having  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  in our hospital and 926 patients received  chemotherapy and/or thoracic radiotherapy  .
the administration of  mitomycin c  in addition to  cisplatin-based regimens  for patients with  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  should be carefully considered .
 to examine whether efficacy of postoperative oral administration of  uft , a 5-fluorouracil derivative chemotherapeutic agent  , may be influenced by incidence of apoptosis ( apoptosis index ) or apoptosis-related gene status ( p53 and bcl-2 ) of the tumour , a total of 162 patients with  pathologic stage i non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  were retrospectively reviewed .
 urpose : to assess results with twice-daily high-dose  radiotherapy ( rt )  for  non-small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  .
methods : we placed  stents  for both  esophageal and tracheobronchial stenoses  in 8 patients ( 7 with esophageal cancer and 1 with <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ) .
 objectives : to review the spectrum of presentation and the  surgical management  of  non small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  and the role of various diagnostic modalities in predicting the post-operative stage and the correlation of the post-operative stage with the chances of recurrence .
 to explore the induction of  chemotherapy ( ct )  dna damage and its correlation with tumor response and patient survival , we undertook the present study in 20  small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  patients .
promising results have also been found with  oxaliplatin  in patients with  non-hodgkin 's lymphoma , breast cancer , mesothelioma and non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
the drug is currently in phase iii clinical trials for patients with  non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  in combination with  paclitaxel and carboplatin  , as well as in  advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer  in combination with  mitoxantrone  .
 objective : several reports emphasize the importance of  en-bloc resection  as the optimal surgical treatment of  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  with chest wall invasion .
methods : between 1981 and 1998 , 100 patients ( 90 male ; ten female ) , with a median age of 60 years ( 36-84 ) , underwent  radical en-bloc resection  of  non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  with chest wall involvement .
over the past 17 years ( 1981 to 1997 ) , 29 patients underwent  complete pulmonary resection  for  primary <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  accompanied by satellite nodules in the same lobe as the primary .
of 1 , 042 patients with  primary <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  who underwent  resection  from 1982 to 1995 , 549 patients with adenocarcinoma ( ad ) and 363 with squamous cell carcinoma ( sq ) were included in this study .
for  small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  , which accounts for approximately 20 % of cases of lung cancer , the primary treatment is  chemotherapy  and in the majority of cases the primary aim is to control the disease which generally would have spread beyond the lungs at the time of presentation .
for  small cell lung cancer ( sclc )  , which accounts for approximately 20 % of cases of <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> , the primary treatment is  chemotherapy  and in the majority of cases the primary aim is to control the disease which generally would have spread beyond the lungs at the time of presentation .
 a growing body of evidence suggests that  postoperative irradiation  for  non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  may cause life-threatening toxicity and , when the risk of local-regional recurrence is low , the toxicity of irradiation may outweight the benefit .
 for patients with  stage i or ii non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( nsclc )  ,  surgical resection  is considered the standard of care .
 background :  prophylactic cranial irradiation  halves the rate of brain metastases in patients with  small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
objectives : this study aims to test whether  prophylactic cranial irradiation  prolongs survival of patients with  small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  in complete remission .
reviewer 's conclusions :  prophylactic cranial irradiation  significantly improves survival and disease-free survival for patients with  small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  in complete remission .
methods :  non-small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  cells were treated with  gemcitabine  , harvested , and nuclear extracts analyzed for nf-kappab dna binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
  combination chemotherapy  is the cornerstone of treatment that confers a meaningful survival benefit for patients with  small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
in single-agent phase ii studies ,  irinotecan  yielded response rates between 16 % and 47 % in patients with previously treated  small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
a phase ii study of  irinotecan in combination with cisplatin ( platinol )  resulted in a response rate of 86 % and a median survival of 13.0 months in patients with  extensive-disease small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
based on these results , the  irinotecan and cisplatin combination  is a new standard regimen in the treatment of  extensive-disease small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
 background : both  gemcitabine and etoposide  are active in the treatment of  small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( sclc )  , and are characterised by mild toxicity profiles .
 background : to find the maximum tolerated dose for  ifosfamide in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin  in  small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  patients ( sclc ) , who are resistant to cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin and etoposide ( cde ) .
many  endobronchial treatment modalities  are available to supplement traditional therapies for  advanced <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
methods : the author reviews the use of several  endobronchial treatment modalities that can augment standard antitumor therapies  for advanced  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  , including rigid and flexible bronchoscopy , laser therapy , endobronchial prosthesis , and photodynamic therapy .
conclusions :  endobronchial interventions  are important adjuncts in the multimodality management of  <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  and should become standard considerations in the management of patients with advanced lung cancer .

patients who benefit from a  surgical resection  for  non-small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  with aneuploid dna content prove to have a higher risk of death .
 purpose : this randomized trial was designed to determine whether  paclitaxel plus carboplatin ( pc )  offered a survival advantage over  vinorelbine plus cisplatin ( vc )  for patients with  advanced non -- small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
conclusion :  pc  is equally efficacious as  vc  for the treatment of  advanced non -- small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS>  .
 purpose : a prospective randomized trial in small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( sclc ) was performed to determine if intensification of the platinum dose by giving  cisplatin and carboplatin  in combination to patients with  sclc  yields higher response rates and survival , than  carboplatin alone in a combination chemotherapy regimen  .
 the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among technetium-99m tetrofosmin ( tc-tf ) accumulation in untreated small cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( sclc ) , the expression of p-glycoprotein ( pgp ) and multidrug resistance related protein-1 ( mrp1 ) , and the response to  chemotherapy  in patients with  untreated sclc  .
  prophylactic cranial irradiation ( pci )  has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the incidence of brain relapse from  limited disease small-cell <DIS>lung cancer</DIS> ( ld sclc )  , but concerns about neurologic toxicity remain .

 Treatment of  postmenopausal <DIS>osteoporosis</DIS>  .
 570 patients with  <DIS>osteosarcoma </DIS>of the extremities  were treated with five different protocols of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  at rizzoli institute between 1983 and 1995 .
we conclude that for patients with  <DIS>osteosarcoma </DIS>of the extremities  treated with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  : ( a ) the pattern of systemic relapse changes according to the efficacy of the protocol of chemotherapy used .
PARTICIPANTS : Institutions selected 798 persons representing families ( 1 person for each family ) thought to be at elevated a priori risk of BRCA1 mutation due to potential risk factors , such as multiple cases of  breast cancer  , early age of  breast cancer  diagnosis , and cases of  <DIS>ovarian cancer</DIS>  .
Characteristics of a patient 's specific diagnosis ( unilateral or bilateral  breast cancer  , with or without  <DIS>ovarian cancer</DIS>  ) , early age at diagnosis , Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity , and family history of cancer were positively associated with the probability of her carrying a deleterious BRCA1 mutation .
  <DIS>Ovarian cancer</DIS>  : diagnostic limitations , treatment obstacles .
 More than 20 years second-look  surgery  in  advanced epithelial <DIS>ovarian cancer</DIS>  : what did we learn ? 
in patients with  advanced <DIS>ovarian cancer</DIS>  , first-line therapy with  oxaliplatin/cyclophosphamide  achieved an objective response rate which did not differ significantly from that of  cisplatin/cyclophosphamide  ( 33 vs 42 % ) .
in addition ,  oxaliplatin  has shown efficacy in patients with  platinum-pretreated <DIS>ovarian cancer</DIS>  and achieved objective response rates similar to paclitaxel in this setting ( 16 vs 17 % ) .
additional clinical investigation of  oxaliplatin  in patients with other  cancers  is warranted given the promising results achieved in early trials , most notably in patients with platinum-pretreated <DIS>ovarian cancer</DIS> .
in a pivotal phase iii trial , 242 patients with  advanced <DIS>ovarian cancer</DIS>  were randomised to receive treatment with  cisplatin  100 mg/m2 and  cyclophosphamide  1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with or without pretreatment with intravenous amifostine 910 mg/m2 .

OBJECTIVE : To investigate phenotypic characteristics of families potentially linked to the hereditary <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS> 1 ( HPC1 ) locus on chromosome 1q24-25 .
FAMILIES : A total of 74 North American families with hereditary  <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS>  .
<DIS>Prostate cancer</DIS> cases from the National Cancer Data Base were used as a reference population for comparison .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The families were divided into 2 groups : either potentially linked ( 33 families with 133 men with  <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS>  ) , and thus likely to be carrying an altered HPC1 gene , or potentially unlinked ( 41 families with 172 men with  prostate cancer  ) , on the basis of haplotype analysis in the region of HPC1 .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The families were divided into 2 groups : either potentially linked ( 33 families with 133 men with  prostate cancer  ) , and thus likely to be carrying an altered HPC1 gene , or potentially unlinked ( 41 families with 172 men with  <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS>  ) , on the basis of haplotype analysis in the region of HPC1 .
The age at diagnosis of  <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS>  , serum prostate-specific antigen levels , digital rectal examination status , stage , grade , primary treatment of  prostate cancers  , and occurrence of other  cancers  were compared between the groups .
RESULTS : The mean age at diagnosis of  <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS>  for men in potentially linked families was significantly lower than for men in potentially unlinked families ( 63.7 vs 65.9 years , respectively , P=.01 ; mean age at diagnosis in the reference population was 71.6 years ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Families that provide evidence for segregation of an altered HPC1 gene are characterized by multiple cases of  <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS>  that , in most respects , are indistinguishable from nonhereditary cases .
Our study shows that a significant fraction of hereditary  prostate cancers  are diagnosed in advanced stages , emphasizing the clinical importance of early detection in men potentially carrying <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS> susceptibility genes .
These findings support the current recommendations to screen men with a positive family history of  <DIS>prostate cancer</DIS>  beginning at age 40 years .

 A systematic review of five  systemic treatments  for  severe <DIS>psoriasis</DIS>  .
  Active forms of vitamin D3 , 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3  , were administered in an open-design study to 40 patients with  <DIS>psoriasis</DIS> vulgaris  in three ways : to 17 patients 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 1.0 micrograms/day for 6 months , to four patients 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 0.5 microgram/day for 6 months , and 19 patients were given 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 applied topically at concentration of 0.5 microgram/g of base for 8 weeks .
These data suggest that  <DIS>psoriasis</DIS>  may respond to  active metabolites of vitamin D3  and that abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism or in responsiveness of the skin cells to active metabolites of vitamin D may be involved in the pathogenesis of this skin disease .

 BACKGROUND :  Thrombolytic treatment  has been shown to accelerate resolution of  major <DIS>pulmonary embolism</DIS>  and lead to a rapid improvement of right-side hemodynamics .
METHODS AND RESULTS : The present multicenter registry included 719 consecutive patients with  major <DIS>pulmonary embolism</DIS>  according to clinical , echocardiographic , scintigraphic , and cardiac catheterization criteria .
<TO_SEE> Patients who underwent early thrombolytic treatment had a reduced rate of recurrent <DIS>pulmonary embolism</DIS> ( 7.7 versus 18.7 % , P & # 60 ; .001 ) but also a higher frequency of major bleeding episodes ( 21.9 % versus 7.8 % , P & # 60 ; .001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The results of our study suggest that  thrombolysis  may favorably affect the clinical outcome of hemodynamically stable patients with  major <DIS>pulmonary embolism</DIS>  .

 <TO_SEE> BACKGROUND : The growing teratoma syndrome refers to the phenomenon whereby germ cell <DIS>tumors </DIS>enlarge after chemotherapy despite complete eradication of malignant cells and normalization of serum tumor markers .
clinically ,  oral administration of uft  has proved to be effective as an  adjuvant therapy  after surgery for some  malignant <DIS>tumors </DIS>such as non-small cell lung cancer  .
 several studies have suggested that  non-small cell lung cancer ( nsclc )  patients whose <DIS>tumors </DIS>have neuroendocrine ( ne ) features may be more responsive to  chemotherapy  in addition , increased expression of p53 and her2 may confer relative chemotherapy resistance and shortened survival .
despite the poor overall prognosis in high-grade  neuroendocrine <DIS>tumors </DIS>of the lung  ,  surgery  remains a viable adjunct in the early stages of this disease .
 In a follow-up study operative risk , postoperative functional disorders and incidence of anastomotic ( recurrent ) <DIS>ulcer </DIS>after  partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy  for  gastroduodenal ulcer  were evaluated in 52 patients .
<TO_SEE> With regard to the high rate of  recurrent ulcer   Roux-en-Y reconstruction  after  partial gastrectomy  for  primary <DIS>ulcer </DIS>surgery  should be avoided and reconstruction procedures preferred , which guarantee duodenogastric reflux .
In patients with  combination therapy  , a further reduction of  viremia  level could be observed , whereas <DIS>viremia </DIS>levels in patients with IFN alpha alone slightly increased .
  d-penicillamine ( 2-amino-3-mercapto-3-methylbutanoic acid ) , a well-known heavy metal chelator  , is the drug of choice in the treatment of  <DIS>wilson 's disease  </DIS>and is also effective for the treatment of  several disorders including rheumatoid arthritis , primary biliary cirrhosis , scleroderma , fibrotic lung diseases and progressive systemic sclerosis  .
